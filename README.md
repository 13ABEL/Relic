## Android Reddit Client
This is an Android Reddit client I've been working on for a few months now. I started this project with the intention of improving my skills as a mobile developer and designer

## Development setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the project in android studio and add an new resource file called "secrets"
3. Add a new string with name: "client_id"
4. Add your api key as the resource value

## List of Todo's off the top of my head
1. Add a folder for decisions and architecture overview
2. Make a list of libraries and tech being used
3. Get more familiar with AAC (Especially livedata and the Android lifecycle)
