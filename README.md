# Relic

The project is currently a WIP. Updates and progress can be found [here](./docs/updates.md)

## Why Relic? (WIP)

Relic is an open source Reddit client developed from the ground up with offline use in mind.

## About

This is an Android Reddit client I've been working off/on for a few months now. It's a pet project that started as a way to learn new skills (Android dev, mobile design) and has since become a primary focus for me. I try to work on it when I can between school and other stuff I'm learning :)

As of now, the project is in a state of constant flux! I'm still learning new things and trying to balance development between architectural decisions and speed. APIs and features will be changing regularly so I've opted to wait until a more stable base version to add tests. For the same reason, I will be pushing my commits directly to master and **NOT** keeping my changes tidy. I've considered the options and opted for this because I will be the only person working on the project until V1 and I want to maintain my velocity.

Once the stable base application with the basic functionality I expect for a Reddit client is reached and sufficient tests have been added, I will release it as v1. From there, expect clean contributions with pull requests and tight changes. Contributions will also be opened and I will be actively working to introduce new features and a better experience for app users.

I have a lot of ideas that I want to implement, but my primary focus for now is to implement basic client functionality. I'm also going to be spending a lot more time tidying up documentation in the next few days
